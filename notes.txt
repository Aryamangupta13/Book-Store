1) express.json();
    express.json() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object 
    as a JSON Object.
    This method is called as a middleware in your application using
    the code: app.use(express.json());

2) diffrence between app=express() and router=express.router();
  -> express() handles server connection, routes, middleware,
   implementation of pages (HTML && CSS to be directed to a route) 
   and communication with databases (like SQL) while our routers
   only handle routes just like a person on the street would give a tourist
    directions to where they want to go.

3) what is cors(cross origin resourse sharing) ?
-> 
    cors is security mecanism to restrict other hosts to access data 
    from our hostx
    cors policy restrict ports to communicate with each other hence to
let thesse ports to communicate  

4) We use default port number for react-app which is 3000 to change go to package.json
and give port=portnumber there

5) useEffect Hook in reactjs
-> useEffect is hook when we want to perform somthing when the page is rendered
useEffect(()=>{

},[]//until this array remanins same useeffect do not run);
